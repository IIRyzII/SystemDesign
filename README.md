"# SystemDesign" 

This is a design for a POS system, it must fit our set requirements.
Those requirements are :

1.Images opposed to text and colours when comes to assortment items like fruit on website

2.Fewer and larger image opposed to more and smaller images on website

3.Big buttons so not as many misclicks on website

4.Having a rough idea of items weight so that the correct quantity of items are processed so shipping can be calculated or in shop to save the same item being scanned multiple times for each iteration

5.Not being able to scan another item before the most recent scanned is registered as in the bag both online and in store

6.Stock can only be changed in person and changes for all terminals at once as well as the online database

7.Users can choose to click and collect or request delivery

8.Users sign in or sign up

9.Users can save their addresses and payments to their account

10. Users are given a barcode for employees to scan when collecting shopping

11. Users will start on the home page

12. Users will have to have an account to make an order

13. Users will earn points on each order

14. Users will earn discounts and other rewards for higher membership tiers

This is for a purely hypothetically scenario.
